# 🦸‍♂️ Marvel Comic API Project 🦸‍♂️

🚀 Welcome to our project using the Marvel API. This project was suggested in an academic context to explore the Nest.js framework.

In this repository, you can find the completed API project along with the frontend project. Additionally, the API documentation is available, providing all the necessary information for consuming the custom API. To facilitate understanding of the data response, in the "Routes" folder, there is an Insomnia file where all available routes are already organized.
